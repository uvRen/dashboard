# insight widget api

This package includes composers that are designed specifically to work with the insight API.

## filterable
The filterable composer adds the XdsFilter component into the settings section of the widget. It sets the value into setting.filter.

## pageable
The pageable composers adds a pagination element underneath the widget. It sets the value into setting.page.

## pageSizable
The pageSizable composer adds a page size drop down list to the settings section. It sets the value into setting.pageSize.

## queryBound
The queryBound composer adds query capability to the widget. It takes setting.pageSize, setting.page, setting.dataStore and setting.filter into account.
It also maps the query result onto the child widget: { total: 0, result: []}.
Every change on filter, dataStore, page and pageSize triggers a data fetch.

## storeBound
Usually all widgets in insight are store bound. This composer adds a data store selector into the settings panel. It sets the value into setting.dataStore.
